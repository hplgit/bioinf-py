===== Dot Plots from Pair of DNA Sequences =====
label{bioinf:dotplot}


Dot plots are commonly used to visualize the similarity between two protein or
nucleic acid sequences. They compare two sequences, say `d1` and `d2`,
by organizing `d1`
along the x-axis and `d2` along the y-axis of a plot.
When `d1[i] == d2[j]` we mark this by drawing a dot at location
`i,j` in the plot. An example is
!bc dat
1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
!ec
The origin is in the upper left corner, which means that the
first string has its indices running to the right 0, 1, 2, and so forth,
while the second string has its indices running down, row by row.

In the forthcoming examples, a dot is represented by 1. No presence at
a given location is represented by 0. A dot plot can be manually read
to find common patterns between two sequences that has undergone
several insertions and deletions, and it serves as a conceptual basis
for algorithms that align two sequences in order to find evolutionary
origin or shared functional parts. Such alignment of biological
sequences is a particular variant of finding the edit distance between
strings, which is a general technique, also used for, e.g., spell
correction in search engines.

The dot plot data structure must mimic a table.  The "x" direction is
along rows, while the "y" direction is along columns. First we need to
initialize the whole data structure with zeros. Then, for each for
each position in the "x string" we run through all positions in the "y
string" and mark those where the characters match with 1.
The algorithm will be clear when presented with specific Python code.

=== Using Lists of Lists ===

Since the plot is essentially a table, a list of lists is therefore
a natural data structure. The following function creates the
list of lists:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/dotplot.py fromto: def dotplot_list_of_lists@dna_x = 'T

To view the dot plot we need to print out the list of lists. Here
is a possible way:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/dotplot.py fromto: dna_x = 'T@def make_string

The output becomes
!bc dat
1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
!ec

One can, alternatively, translate the list of lists to a multi-line string
containing the whole plot as a string object.
This implies joining all the characters in each row and then joining
all the rows:
!bc pycod
rows = [' '.join(row) for row in dotplot_matrix]
plot = '\n'.join(rows)
# or combined
plot = '\n'.join([' '.join(row) for row in dotplot_matrix])
!ec
${not_primer_book_comment("""The construction `'d'.join(l)` joints
all the string elements of the
list `l` and inserts `d` as delimiter: `'x'.join(['A','B','C'])`
becomes `'AxBxC'`.""")}
We use a space as delimiter among the characters in a row since this
gives a nice layout when printing the string. All rows are joined with
newline as delimiter such that the rows appear on separate lines when
printing the string.  To really understand what is going on, a more
comprehensive code could be made so that each step can be examined:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/dotplot.py fromto: def make_string_expanded@# end of testing join operations in detail

Unless the join operation as used here is well understood, it is highly
recommended to paste the above code into the
"Online Python Tutor": "http://www.pythontutor.com/",
step through the code, and watch how variables change their content.
Figure ref{bioinf:fig:pot2} shows a snapshot of this type of code investigation.

=== Using Numerical Python Arrays ===

A Numerical Python array, with integer elements that equal 0 or 1,
is well suited as data structure to hold a dot plot.

@@@CODE src-bioinf/dotplot.py fromto: def dotplot_numpy@dna_x = 'ATT

The two dot plot functions are available
in the file "`dotplot.py`": "${src_path}/dotplot.py".
