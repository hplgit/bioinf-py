We shall here continue the bioinformatics applications started
in Section ref{bioinf:basics}. Analysis of DNA sequences is
conveniently done in Python, much with the aid of lists, dictionaries,
`numpy` arrays, strings, and files. This will be illustrated
through a series of examples.

===== Computing Frequencies =====
label{bioinf:freqm}

idx{frequency matrix}

Your genetic code is essentially the same from you are born until you
die, and the same in your blood and your brain.  Which genes that are
turned on and off make the difference between the cells. This
regulation of genes is orchestrated by an immensely complex mechanism,
which we have only started to understand. A central part of this
mechanism consists of molecules called transcription factors that
float around in the cell and attach to DNA, and in doing so turn
nearby genes on or off. These molecules bind preferentially to
specific DNA sequences, and this binding preference pattern can be
represented by a table of frequencies of given symbols at each
position of the pattern.  More precisely, each row in the table
corresponds to the bases A, C, G, and T, while column j reflects how
many times the base appears in position j in the DNA sequence.

For example, if our set of DNA sequences are
TAG, GGT, and GGG, the table becomes

  |------------------|
  | base | 0 | 1 | 2 |
  |--l-----c---c---c-|
  | A    | 0 | 1 | 0 |
  | C    | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  | G    | 2 | 2 | 2 |
  | T    | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  |------------------|

From this table we can read that base A appears once in index 1 in the
DNA strings, base C does not appear at all, base G appears twice in
all positions, and base T appears once in the beginning and end of the
strings.

In the following we shall present different data structures to
hold such a table and different ways of computing them.
The table is known as a *frequency matrix* in bioinformatics
and this is the term used here too.


=== Separate Frequency Lists ===

Since we know that there are only four rows in the frequency matrix,
an obvious data structure would be four lists, each holding
a row. A function computing these lists may look like

@@@CODE src-bioinf/freq.py fromto: def freq_lists@dna_list =

We need to initialize the lists with the right length and a zero
for each element, since each list element is to be used as a counter.
Creating a list of length `n` with object `x` in all positions
is done by `[x]*n`. Finding the proper length is here carried out by
inspecting the length of the first element in `dna_list`, the list of
all DNA strings to be counted, assuming
that all elements in this list have the same length.

idx{`enumerate`}

In the `for` loop we apply the `enumerate` function, which is used
to extract both the element value *and* the element index when
iterating over a sequence. For example,
!bc pyshell
>>> for index, base in enumerate(['t', 'e', 's', 't']):
...   print index, base
...
0 t
1 e
2 s
3 t
!ec

Here is a test,
!bc pycod
dna_list = ['GGTAG', 'GGTAC', 'GGTGC']
A, C, G, T = freq_lists(dna_list)
print A
print C
print G
print T
!ec
with output
!bc dat
[0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
[3, 3, 0, 1, 1]
[0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
!ec

=== Nested List ===

The frequency matrix can also be represented as a nested list `M`
such that `M[i][j]` is the frequency of base `i` in position `j`
in the set of DNA strings. Here `i` is an integer, where 0 corresponds to A,
1 to T, 2 to G, and 3 to C. The frequency is the number of times
base `i` appears in position `j` in a set of DNA strings.
Sometimes this number is divided by the number of DNA strings in
the set so that the frequency is between 0 and 1. Note that all
the DNA strings must have the same length.

The simplest way to make a nested list is to insert the
`A`, `C`, `G`, and `T` lists into another list:
!bc pycod
>>> frequency_matrix = [A, C, G, T]
>>> frequency_matrix[2][3]
2
>>> G[3]  # same element
2
!ec

Alternatively, we can illustrate how to compute this type of nested
list directly:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/freq.py fromto: def freq_list_of_lists_v1@frequency_matrix = freq_list_of_lists_v1\(

As in the case with individual lists we need to initialize all elements
in the nested list to zero.

A call and printout,
!bc pycod
dna_list = ['GGTAG', 'GGTAC', 'GGTGC']
frequency_matrix = freq_list_of_lists_v1(dna_list)
print frequency_matrix
!ec
results in
!bc dat
[[0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [3, 3, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]]
!ec

=== Dictionary for More Convenient Indexing ===

idx{dictionary}

The series of `if` tests in the Python function `freq_list_of_lists_v1`
are somewhat cumbersome,
especially if we want to extend the code to other bioinformatics problems
where the alphabet is larger. What we want is a mapping from `base`,
which is a character, to the corresponding index 0, 1, 2, or 3.
A Python dictionary may represent such mappings:
!bc pyshell
>>> base2index = {'A': 0, 'C': 1, 'G': 2, 'T': 3}
>>> base2index['G']
2
!ec
With the `base2index` dictionary we do not need the series of
`if` tests and the alphabet `'ATGC'` could be much larger
without affecting the length of the code:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/freq.py fromto: def freq_list_of_lists_v2@import numpy

=== Numerical Python Array ===

As long as each sublist in a list of lists has the same length, a
list of lists can be replaced by a Numerical Python (`numpy`) array.
Processing of such arrays is often much more efficient than
processing of the nested list data structure.
To initialize a two-dimensional `numpy` array we need to know its
size, here 4 times `len(dna_list[0])`. Only the first line in the function
`freq_list_of_lists_v2` needs to be changed in order to utilize
a `numpy` array:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/freq.py fromto: import numpy@def freq_dict_of_lists_v1

The resulting `frequency_matrix` object can be indexed as
`[b][i]` or `[b,i]`, with integers `b` and `i`. Typically, `b` will
be something line `base2index['C']`.

=== Dictionary of Lists ===

Instead of going from a character to an integer index via
`base2index`, we may prefer to index `frequency_matrix` by the base name
and the position index directly, like in `['C'][14]`.
This is the most natural syntax for a user of the
frequency matrix.  The relevant Python data structure is then a
dictionary of lists. That is, `frequency_matrix` is a dictionary with
keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`. The value for each key is a
list. Let us now also extend the flexibility such that `dna_list` can
have DNA strings of different lengths. The lists in `frequency_list`
will have lengths equal to the longest DNA string.  A relevant
function is

@@@CODE src-bioinf/freq.py fromto: def freq_dict_of_lists_v1@frequency_matrix = freq_dict_of_lists_v1\(

Running the test code

@@@CODE src-bioinf/freq.py fromto: frequency_matrix = freq_dict_of_lists_v1@def freq_dict_of_lists_v2
results in the output
!bc dat
{'A': [0, 0, 0, 2, 0],
 'C': [0, 0, 0, 0, 2],
 'G': [3, 3, 0, 1, 1],
 'T': [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]}
!ec

The initialization of `frequency_matrix` in the above code can
be made more compact by using a dictionary comprehension:
!bc pycod
dict = {key: value for key in some_sequence}
!ec
In our example we set
!bc pycod
frequency_matrix = {base: [0]*n for base in 'ACGT'}
!ec
Adopting this construction in the `freq_dict_of_lists_v1` function
leads to a slightly more compact version:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/freq.py fromto: def freq_dict_of_lists_v2@def freq_dict_of_dicts_v1

idx{`max` function}

As an additional comment on computing the maximum length of the DNA
strings can be made as there are several alternative ways of doing
this.  The classical use of `max` is to apply it to a list as done
above:
!bc pycod
n = max([len(dna) for dna in dna_list])
!ec
However, for very long lists it is possible to avoid the memory demands
of storing the result of the list comprehension, i.e., the list of
lengths. Instead `max` can work with the lengths as they are computed:
!bc pycod
n = max(len(dna) for dna in dna_list)
!ec
It is also possible to write
!bc pycod
n = max(dna_list, key=len)
!ec
Here, `len` is applied to each element in `dna_list`, and the
maximum of the resulting values is returned.

=== Dictionary of Dictionaries ===

The dictionary of lists data structure can alternatively be replaced
by a dictionary of dictionaries object, often just called a dict of
dicts object. That is, `frequency_matrix[base]` is a dictionary with
key `i` and value equal to the added number of occurrences of `base` in
`dna[i]` for all `dna` strings in the list `dna_list`.  The indexing
`frequency_matrix['C'][i]` and the values are exactly as in the last
example; the only difference is whether `frequency_matrix['C']` is a
list or dictionary.

Our function working with `frequency_matrix` as a dict of dicts
is written as

@@@CODE src-bioinf/freq.py fromto: def freq_dict_of_dicts_v1@from collections import default

=== Using Dictionaries with Default Values ===

The manual initialization of each subdictionary to zero,
!bc pycod
    frequency_matrix = {base: {index: 0 for index in range(n)}
                        for base in 'ACGT'}
!ec
can be simplified by using a dictionary with default values for any
key. The construction `defaultdict(lambda: obj)`
makes a dictionary with `obj` as default value.
This construction simplifies the previous function a bit:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/freq.py fromto: from collections import default@_matrix = freq_list_of_lists_v2

__Remark.__
Dictionary comprehensions were new in Python 2.7 and 3.1, but can be
simulated in earlier versions by making (key, value) tuples via
list comprehensions. A dictionary comprehension
!bc pycod
d = {key: value for key in sequence}
!ec
is then constructed as
!bc pycod
d = dict([(key, value) for key in sequence])
!ec

=== Using Arrays and Vectorization ===

The `frequency_matrix` dict of lists for can easily be
changed to a dict of `numpy` arrays: just replace the initialization
`[0]*n` by `np.zeros(n, dtype=np.int)`. The indexing remains the same:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/freq.py fromto: def freq_dict_of_arrays_v1@def freq_dict_of_arrays_v2

Having `frequency_matrix[base]` as a `numpy` array instead of a list
does not give any immediate advantage, as the storage and CPU time is
about the same. The loop over the `dna` string and the associated
indexing is what consumes all the CPU time.  However, the `numpy`
arrays provide a potential for increasing efficiency through
vectorization, i.e., replacing the element-wise operations on `dna`
and `frequency_matrix[base]` by operations on the entire arrays at
once.

Let us use the interactive Python shell to
explore the possibilities of vectorization.
We first convert the string to a `numpy` array of characters:
!bc pycod
>>> dna = 'ACAT'
>>> dna = np.array(dna, dtype='c')
>>> dna
array(['A', 'C', 'A', 'T'],
      dtype='|S1')
!ec
For a given base, say A, we can in one vectorized operation find
which locations in `dna` that contain `A`:
!bc pycod
>>> b = dna == 'A'
>>> b
array([ True, False,  True, False], dtype=bool)
!ec
By converting `b` to an integer array `i` we can
update the frequency counts
for all indices by adding `i` to `frequency_matrix['A']`:
!bc pycod
>>> i = np.asarray(b, dtype=np.int)
>>> i
array([1, 0, 1, 0])
>>> frequency_matrix['A'] = frequency_matrix['A'] + i
!ec
This recipe can be repeated for all bases:
!bc pycod
    for dna in dna_list:
        dna = np.array(dna, dtype='c')
        for base in 'ACGT':
            b = dna == base
            i = np.asarray(b, dtype=np.int)
            frequency_matrix[base] = frequency_matrix[base] + i
!ec

It turns out that we do not need to convert the boolean array `b`
to an integer array `i`, because doing arithmetics with `b` directly
is possible: `False` is interpreted as 0 and `True` as 1 in arithmetic
operations.  We can also use
the `+=` operator to update all elements of `frequency_matrix[base]`
directly, without first computing the sum of two arrays
`frequency_matrix[base] + i` and then assigning this result to
`frequency_matrix[base]`.
Collecting all these ideas in one function yields the code

@@@CODE src-bioinf/freq.py fromto: def freq_dict_of_arrays_v2@# ----
This vectorized function runs almost 10 times as fast as the
(scalar) counterpart `freq_list_of_arrays_v1`!

===== Analyzing the Frequency Matrix =====
label{bioinf:freq:analysis}

Having built a frequency matrix out of a collection of DNA strings, it
is time to use it for analysis.
The short DNA strings that a frequency matrix is built out of, is
typically a set of substrings of a larger DNA sequence, which shares
some common purpose. An example of this is to have a set of substrings
that serves as a kind of anchors/magnets at which given molecules
attach to DNA and perform biological functions (like turning genes on
or off). With the frequency matrix constructed from a limited set of
known anchor locations (substrings), we can now scan for other similar
substrings that have the potential to perform the same function. The
simplest way to do this is to first determine the most typical
substring according to the frequency matrix, i.e., the substring having
the most frequent nucleotide at each position. This is referred to as
the consensus string of the frequency matrix. We can then look for
occurrences of the consensus substring in a larger DNA sequence, and
consider these occurrences as likely candidates for serving the same
function (e.g., as anchor locations for molecules).

For instance,
given three substrings ACT, CCA and AGA, the frequency matrix
would be (list of lists, with rows corresponding to A, C, G, and T):
!bc dat
[[2, 0, 2]
 [1, 2, 0]
 [0, 1, 0]
 [0, 0, 1]]
!ec
We see that for position 0,
which corresponds to the left-most column in the table, the symbol A has the
highest frequency (2). The maximum frequencies for the other positions
are seen to be C for position 1, and A for position 2. The consensus
string is therefore ACA.  Note that the consensus string does not need to be
equal to any of the substrings that formed the basis of the frequency
matrix (this is indeed the case for the above example).


=== List of Lists Frequency Matrix ===

Let `frequency_matrix` be a list of lists. For each position `i` we
run through the rows in the frequency matrix and keep track of the
maximum frequency value and the corresponding letter. If two or
more letters have the same frequency value we use a dash to
indicate that this position in the consensus string is undetermined.

The following function computes the consensus string:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/freq.py fromto: def find_consensus_v1@def find_consensus_v2

Since this code requires `frequency_matrix` to be a list of lists
we should insert a test and raise an exception if the
type is wrong:
!bc pycod
def find_consensus_v1(frequency_matrix):
    if isinstance(frequency_matrix, list) and \
       isinstance(frequency_matrix[0], list):
        pass # right type
    else:
        raise TypeError('frequency_matrix must be list of lists')
    ...
!ec

=== Dict of Dicts Frequency Matrix ===

How must the `find_consensus_v1` function be altered if `frequency_matrix`
is a dict of dicts?

  o The `base2index` dict is no longer needed.
  o Access of sublist, `frequency_matrix[0]`, to test for type and
    length of the strings, must be replaced
    by `frequency_matrix['A']`.

The updated function becomes

@@@CODE src-bioinf/freq.py fromto: def find_consensus_v3@frequency_matrix = freq_dict_of_dicts_v1

Here is a test:
!bc pycod
frequency_matrix = freq_dict_of_dicts_v1(dna_list)
pprint.pprint(frequency_matrix)
print find_consensus_v3(frequency_matrix)
!ec
with output
!bc dat
{'A': {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 2, 4: 0},
 'C': {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 2},
 'G': {0: 3, 1: 3, 2: 0, 3: 1, 4: 1},
 'T': {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 3, 3: 0, 4: 0}}
Consensus string: GGTAC
!ec

Let us try `find_consensus_v3` with the dict of defaultdicts
as input (`freq_dicts_of_dicts_v2`). The code runs fine, but
the output string is just `G`!
The reason is that `dna_length` is 1, and therefore that the length of
the `A` dict in `frequency_matrix` is 1.
Printing out `frequency_matrix` yields
!bc pycod
{'A': defaultdict(X, {3: 2}),
 'C': defaultdict(X, {4: 2}),
 'G': defaultdict(X, {0: 3, 1: 3, 3: 1, 4: 1}),
 'T': defaultdict(X, {2: 3})}
!ec
where our `X` is a short form for text like
!bc pycod
`<function <lambda> at 0xfaede8>`
!ec
We see that the length of a defaultdict will only count the nonzero
entries. Hence, to use a defaultdict our function must get the length of the DNA string to
build as an extra argument:
!bc pycod
def find_consensus_v4(frequency_matrix, dna_length):
    ...
!ec

Exercise ref{bioinf:exer:freq:fargs} suggests to make a unified
`find_consensus` function which works with all of the different
representations of `frequency_matrix` that we have used.

The functions making and using the frequency matrix are found
in the file "`freq.py`": "${src_path}/freq.py".
