======= Classes for DNA Analysis =======
label{bioinf:oo}

We shall here exemplify the use of classes for performing
DNA analysis as explained ${primer_book_comment("""in Sections ref{bioinf:count}, ref{bioinf:freqm}, ref{bioinf:freq:analysis}, ref{bioinf:basefreq}, ref{bioinf:gene2protein}, ref{bioinf:lactase:milk}, and ref{bioinf:random}.""")} ${not_primer_book_comment("""in the previous text.""")}
Basically, we create a class `Gene` to represent a DNA sequence (string)
and a class `Region` to represent a subsequence (substring), typically an
exon or intron.

===== Class for Regions =====

The class for representing a region of a DNA string is quite simple:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/dna_classes.py fromto: class Region@class Gene
Besides storing the substring and giving access to it through `get_region`,
we have also included the possibility to

  * say `len(r)` if `r` is a `Region` instance
  * check if two `Region` instances are equal
  * write `r1 + r2` for two instances `r1` and `r2` of type `Region`
  * perform `r1 += r2`

The latter two operations are convenient for making one large string out
of all exon or intron regions.

===== Class for Genes =====

The class for gene will be longer and more complex than class
`Region`. We already have a bunch of functions performing various
types of analysis. The idea of the `Gene` class is that these
functions are methods in the class operating on the DNA string and the
exon regions stored in the class.  Rather than recoding all the
functions as methods in the class we shall just let the class ``wrap''
the functions. That is, the class methods call up the functions we
already have.  This approach has two advantages: users can either
choose the function-based or the class-based interface, and the
programmer can reuse all the ready-made functions when implementing
the class-based interface.

The selection of functions include

 * `generate_string` for generating a random string from some alphabet
 * `download` and `read_dnafile`
   (version `read_dnafile_v1`)
   for downloading data from the Internet and reading from file
 * `read_exon_regions` (version `read_exon_regions_v2`)
   for reading exon regions from file
 * `tofile_with_line_sep` (version `tofile_with_line_sep_v2`)
   for writing strings to file
 * `read_genetic_code` (version `read_genetic_code_v2`) for loading
   the mapping from triplet codes to 1-letter symbols for amino acids
 * `get_base_frequencies` (version `get_base_frequencies_v2`)
   for finding frequencies of each base
 * `format_frequencies` for formatting base frequencies with two decimals
 * `create_mRNA` for computing an mRNA string from DNA and exon regions
 * `mutate` for mutating a base at a random position
 * `create_markov_chain`, `transition`, and `mutate_via_markov_chain`
   for mutating a base at a random position according to randomly
   generated transition probabilities
 * `create_protein_fixed` for proper creation of a protein sequence (string)

The set of plain functions for DNA analysis is found
in the file "`dna_functions.py`": "${src_path}/dna_functions.py", while
"`dna_classes.py`": "${src_path}/dna_classes.py" contains the implementations
of classes `Gene` and `Region`.

=== Basic Features of class Gene ===

Class `Gene` is supposed to hold the DNA sequence and
the associated exon regions. A simple constructor expects the
exon regions to be specified as a list of (start, end) tuples
indicating the start and end of each region:
!bc pycod
class Gene(object):
    def __init__(self, dna, exon_regions):
        self._dna = dna

        self._exon_regions = exon_regions
        self._exons = []
        for start, end in exon_regions:
            self._exons.append(Region(dna, start, end))

        # Compute the introns (regions between the exons)
        self._introns = []
        prev_end = 0
        for start, end in exon_regions:
            self._introns.append(Region(dna, prev_end, start))
            prev_end = end
        self._introns.append(Region(dna, end, len(dna)))
!ec

The methods in class `Gene` are trivial to implement when we already
have the functionality in stand-alone functions.
Here are a few examples on methods:
!bc pycod
from dna_functions import *

class Gene(object):
    ...

    def write(self, filename, chars_per_line=70):
        """Write DNA sequence to file with name filename."""
        tofile_with_line_sep(self._dna, filename, chars_per_line)

    def count(self, base):
        """Return no of occurrences of base in DNA."""
        return self._dna.count(base)

    def get_base_frequencies(self):
        """Return dict of base frequencies in DNA."""
        return get_base_frequencies(self._dna)

    def format_base_frequencies(self):
        """Return base frequencies formatted with two decimals."""
        return format_frequencies(self.get_base_frequencies())
!ec


=== Flexible Constructor ===

The constructor can be made more flexible. First, the exon regions
may not be known so we should allow `None` as value and in fact
use that as default value. Second, exon regions at the start and/or
end of the DNA string will lead to empty intron `Region` objects so a proper
test on nonzero length of the introns must be inserted.
Third, the data for the DNA string and
the exon regions can either be passed as arguments or downloaded and read
from file.
Two different initializations of `Gene` objects are therefore
!bc pycod
g1 = Gene(dna, exon_regions)  # user has read data from file
g2 = Gene((urlbase, dna_file), (urlbase, exon_file))  # download
!ec
One can pass `None` for `urlbase` if the files are already at the
computer. The flexible constructor has, not surprisingly, much longer code
than the first version. The implementation illustrates well how the concept of
overloaded constructors in other languages, like C++ and Java, are
dealt with in Python (overloaded constructors take different types
of arguments to initialize an instance):

@@@CODE src-bioinf/dna_classes.py fromto: class Gene@def create_mRNA

Note that we perform quite detailed testing of the object type
of the data structures supplied as the `dna` and `exon_regions`
arguments. This can well be done to ensure safe use also when there is only
one allowed type per argument.

=== Other Methods ===

A `create_mRNA` method, returning the mRNA as a string, can be coded as

@@@CODE src-bioinf/dna_classes.py fromto: def create_mRNA@def write

Also here we rely on calling an already implemented function, but include
some testing whether asking for mRNA is appropriate.

Methods for creating a mutated gene are also included:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/dna_classes.py fromto: def mutate_pos@def get_dna

Some ``get'' methods that give access to the fundamental attributes
of the class can be included:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/dna_classes.py fromto: def get_dna@def __len
Alternatively, one could access the attributes directly: `gene._dna`,
`gene._exons`, etc. In that case we should remove the leading underscore as
this underscore signals that these
attributes are considered ``protected'', i.e., not to be directly accessed
by the user. The ``protection'' in ``get'' functions is more mental
than actual since we anyway give the data structures in the hands of
the user and she can do whatever she wants (even delete them).

## Note that copying from __len__ interferes with copying from
## the same method in class Region. Hence, we have copied the
## relevant code directly in here.

Special methods for the length of a gene, adding genes, checking if
two genes are identical, and printing of compact gene information
are relevant to add:
!bc pycod
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self._dna)

    def __add__(self, other):
        """self + other: append other to self (DNA string)."""
        if self._exons is None and other._exons is None:
            return Gene(self._dna + other._dna, None)
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                'cannot do Gene + Gene with exon regions')

    def __iadd__(self, other):
        """self += other: append other to self (DNA string)."""
        if self._exons is None and other._exons is None:
            self._dna += other._dna
            return self
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                'cannot do Gene += Gene with exon regions')

    def __eq__(self, other):
        """Check if two Gene instances are equal."""
        return self._dna == other._dna and \
               self._exons == other._exons

    def __str__(self):
        """Pretty print (condensed info)."""
        s = 'Gene: ' + self._dna[:6] + '...' + self._dna[-6:] + \
            ', length=%d' % len(self._dna)
        if self._exons is not None:
            s += ', %d exon regions' % len(self._exons)
        return s
!ec

Here is an interactive session demonstrating how we can work with
class `Gene` objects:
!bc pyshell
>>> from dna_classes import Gene
>>> g1 = Gene('ATCCGTAATTGCGCA', [(2,4), (6,9)])
>>> print g1
Gene: ATCCGT...TGCGCA, length=15, 2 exon regions
>>> g2 = g1.mutate_random(10)
>>> print g2
Gene: ATCCGT...TGTGCT, length=15, 2 exon regions
>>> g1 == g2
False
>>> g1 += g2  # expect exception
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: cannot do Gene += Gene with exon regions
>>> g1b = Gene(g1.get_dna(), None)
>>> g2b = Gene(g2.get_dna(), None)
>>> print g1b
Gene: ATCCGT...TGCGCA, length=15
>>> g3 = g1b + g2b
>>> g3.format_base_frequencies()
'A: 0.17, C: 0.23, T: 0.33, G: 0.27'
!ec


===== Subclasses =====

There are two fundamental types of genes: the most common type that
codes for proteins (indirectly via mRNA) and the type that only codes
for RNA (without being further processed to proteins).
The product of a gene, mRNA or protein, depends on the type of gene we have.
It is then natural to create two subclasses for the two types of
gene and have a method `get_product` which returns the product
of that type of gene.

The `get_product` method can be declared in class `Gene`:
!bc pycod
    def get_product(self):
        raise NotImplementedError(
            'Subclass %s must implement get_product' % \
            self.__class__.__name__)
!ec
The exception here will be triggered by an instance (`self`)
of any subclass that just inherits `get_product` from class `Gene`
without implementing a subclass version of this method.

The two subclasses of `Gene` may take this simple form:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/dna_classes.py fromto: class RNACoding@def test_lactase_gene

A demonstration of how to load the lactase gene and create the
lactase protein is done with

@@@CODE src-bioinf/dna_classes.py fromto: def test_lactase_gene@# Manual downloading and

Now, envision that the Lactase gene would instead have been an
RNA-coding gene. The only necessary changes would have been to exchange
`ProteinCodingGene` by `RNACodingGene` in the assignment to
`lactase_gene`, and one would get out a final RNA product instead of a
protein.
