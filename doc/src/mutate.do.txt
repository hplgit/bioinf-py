=== A Simple Mutation Model ===

${primer_book_comment("""
A fundamental principle of biological evolution is that DNA undergoes
mutation. Since DNA can be represented as a string consisting of the
letters A, C, G, and T, as explained in Section ref{bioinf:basics},
mutation of DNA""")} ${not_primer_book_comment("""Mutation of genes""")}
is easily modeled by replacing the letter in a randomly
chosen position of the DNA by a randomly chosen letter from
the alphabet A, C, G, and T.
${not_primer_book_comment("""Python's `random` module can be used
to generate random numbers. Selecting a random position means
generating a random index in the DNA string, and the function
`random.randint(a, b)` generates random integers between `a` and
`b` (both included). Generating a random
letter is easiest done by having a list of the actual letters
and using `random.choice(list)` to pick an arbitrary element from
`list`.""")} A function for replacing the letter in a
randomly selected position (index)
by a random letter among A, C, G, and T is most straightforwardly
implemented by converting the DNA string to a list of letters, since
changing a character in a Python string is impossible without
constructing a new string. However, an element in a list can be
changed in-place:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/mutate.py fromto: import random@def get_base_frequencies_v2

Using `get_base_frequencies_v2` and `format_frequencies`
from Section ref{bioinf:basefreq}, we can easily mutate a gene a number
of times and see how the frequencies of the bases A, C, G, and T change:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/mutate.py fromto: dna = 'AC@# Vectorized version

Here is the output from a run:
!bc dat
Starting DNA: ACGGAGATTTCGGTATGCAT

DNA after 10000 mutations: AACCAATCCGACGAGGAGTG
A: 0.35, C: 0.25, T: 0.10, G: 0.30

=== Vectorized Version ===

The efficiency of the `mutate_v1` function with its surrounding loop can be
significantly increased up by performing all the mutations at
once using `numpy` arrays. This speed-up is of interest for long `dna`
strings and many mutations. The idea is to draw all the mutation sites
at once, and also all the new bases at these sites at once.
The `np.random` module provides functions for drawing several random
numbers at a time, but only integers and real numbers can be drawn,
not characters from the alphabet A, C, G, and T. We therefore have
to simulate these four characters by the numbers (say) 0, 1, 2, and 3.
Afterwards we can translate the integers to letters by some clever
vectorized indexing.

Drawing `N` mutation sites is a matter of drawing `N` random
integers among the legal indices:
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
mutation_sites = np.random.random_integers(0, len(dna)-1, size=N)
!ec
Drawing `N` bases, represented as the integers 0-3, is similarly done by
!bc pycod
new_bases_i = np.random.random_integers(0, 3, N)
!ec
Converting say the integers 1 to the base symbol C is done by
picking out the indices (in a boolean array) where `new_bases_i`
equals 1, and inserting the character `'C'` in a companion
array of characters:
!bc pycod
new_bases_c = np.zeros(N, dtype='c')
indices = new_bases_i == 1
new_bases_c[indices] = 'C'
!ec
We must do this integer-to-letter conversion for all four integers/letters.
Thereafter, `new_bases_c` must be inserted in `dna` for all the
indices corresponding to the randomly drawn mutation sites,
!bc pycod
dna[mutation_sites] = new_bases_c
!ec
The final step is to convert the `numpy` array of characters `dna`
back to a standard string by first converting `dna` to a list
and then joining the list elements: `''.join(dna.tolist())`.

The complete vectorized function can now be expressed as follows:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/mutate.py fromto: import numpy as np@dna = mutate_v2\(dna

It is of interest to time `mutate_v2` versus `mutate_v1`. For this purpose
we need a long test string. A straightforward generation of random
letters is

@@@CODE src-bioinf/mutate.py fromto: def generate_string_v1@def generate_string_v2

A vectorized version of this function can also be made, using the
ideas explored above for the `mutate_v2` function:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/mutate.py fromto: def generate_string_v2@def time_mutate

The `time_mutate` function in the file "`mutate.py`": "${src_path}/mutate.py" performs
timing of the generation of test strings and the mutations.  To
generate a DNA string of length 100,000 the vectorized function is
about 8 times faster. When performing 10,000 mutations on this string,
the vectorized version is almost 3000 times faster! These numbers stay
approximately the same also for larger strings and more mutations.
Hence, this case study on vectorization is a striking example on the fact
that a straightforward and convenient function like `mutate_v1` might
occasionally be very slow for large-scale computations.


=== A Markov Chain Mutation Model ===

The observed rate at which mutations occur at a given position in the
genome is not independent of the type of nucleotide (base) at that
position, as was assumed in the previous simple mutation model.  We
should therefore take into account that the rate of transition depends
on the base.

There are a number of reasons why the observed mutation rates vary
between different nucleotides. One reason is that there are different
mechanisms generating transitions from one base to another. Another
reason is that there are extensive repair process in living cells, and
the efficiency of this repair mechanism varies for different
nucleotides.

Mutation of nucleotides may be modeled using distinct probabilities
for the transitions from each nucleotide to every other
nucleotide. For example, the probability of replacing A by C may be
prescribed as (say) 0.2. In total we need $4\times 4$|$4x4$
probabilities since each nucleotide can transform into itself (no
change) or three others. The sum of all four transition probabilities
for a given nucleotide must sum up to one. Such statistical evolution,
based on probabilities for transitioning from one state to another, is
known as a Markov process or Markov chain.

First we need to set up the probability matrix, i.e., the
$4\times4$|$4x4$ table of probabilities where each row corresponds to the
transition of A, C, G, or T into A, C, G, or T. Say the probability
transition from A to A is 0.2, from A to C is 0.1, from A to G is 0.3,
and from A to T is 0.4.

Rather than just prescribing some arbitrary transition probabilities
for test purposes, we can use random numbers for these probabilities.
To this end, we generate three random numbers to divide the interval
$[0,1]$ into four intervals corresponding to the four possible
transitions.  The lengths of the intervals give the transition
probabilities, and their sum is ensured to be 1.  The interval limits,
0, 1, and three random numbers must be sorted in ascending order to
form the intervals. We use the function `random.random()` to generate
random numbers in $[0,1)$:
!bc pycod
slice_points = sorted(
    [0] + [random.random() for i in range(3)] + [1])
transition_probabilities = [slice_points[i+1] - slice_points[i]
                            for i in range(4)]
!ec
The transition probabilities are handy to have available as a dictionary:
!bc pycod
markov_chain['A'] = {'A': ..., 'C': ..., 'G': ..., 'T': ...}
!ec
which can be computed by
!bc pycod
markov_chain['A'] = {base: p for base, p in
                     zip('ACGT', transition_probabilities)}
!ec

To select a transition, we need to draw a random letter
(A, C, G, or T) according to the probabilities
`markov_chain[b]` where `b` is the base at the current position.
Actually, this is a very common operation, namely drawing a
random value from a *discrete probability distribution* (`markov_chain[b]`).
The natural approach is therefore write a general function for
drawing from any discrete probability distribution given as
a dictionary:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/mutate.py fromto: def draw\(@def draw_vec

Basically, the algorithm divides $[0,1]$ into intervals of lengths
equal to the probabilities of the various outcomes and checks
which interval is hit by a random variable in $[0,1]$. The corresponding
value is the random choice.

A complete function creating all the transition probabilities and
storing them in a dictionary of dictionaries takes the form

@@@CODE src-bioinf/mutate.py fromto: def create_markov@def check_transition_probabilities

It is natural to develop a function for checking that the generated
probabilities are consistent. The transition from a particular base
into one of the four bases happens with probability 1, which means that
the probabilities in a row must sum up to 1:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/mutate.py fromto: def check_transition@probabilities\(mc

Another test is to check that `draw` actually draws random values
in accordance with the underlying probabilities. To this end, we draw
a large number of values, `N`, count the frequencies of the various values,
divide by `N` and compare the empirical normalized frequencies
with the probabilities:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/mutate.py fromto: def check_draw_approx@def check_draw_vec_approx
This test is only approximate, but does bring evidence to the correctness
of the implementation of the `draw` function.

A vectorized version of `draw` can also be made. We refer to the
source code file "`mutate.py`": "${src_path}/mutate.py"
for details (the function is relatively
complicated).

Now we have all the tools needed to run the Markov chain of
transitions for a randomly selected position in a DNA sequence:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/mutate.py fromto: def mutate_via@dna = 'TTACGGAGATTTCGGTATGCAT'
Exercise ref{bioinf:exer:Markov:chain:eff} suggests some efficiency
enhancements of simulating mutations via these functions.

Here is a simulation of mutations using the method based on Markov chains:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/mutate.py fromto: dna = 'TTACGGAGATTTCGGTATGCAT'@def transition_into

The output will differ each time the program is run unless
`random.seed(i)` is called in the beginning of the program for some
integer `i`. This call makes the
sequence of random numbers the same every time the program is run and
is very useful for debugging. An example on the output may look like
!bc dat

Note that the mutated DNA should contain more nucleotides of the
type where the total probability of transitioning into that particular
nucleotide is largest. The total probability of transitioning into
a particular base can be computed by a bit a probability algebra.
Let $X$ be the initial base at some position in the DNA and let $Y$
be the new base after mutation at this position. The probability
that $P(Y=b)$, where $b$ is some base (A, C, G, or T), is built up
of four mutually exclusive events:
!bt
\[ P(Y=b) = P(X=A \cup Y=b) + P(X=C \cup Y=b) +
P(X=G \cup Y=b) + P(X=T \cup Y=b)\]
!et
A joint event can be expressed by the (conditional) transition
probabilities, e.g.,
!bt
\[ P(X=A \cup Y=b) = P(Y=b | X=A) P(X=A) \]
!et
leading to
!bt
\[ P(Y=b) = \sum_{i\in\{A,C,G,T\}} P(Y=b|X=i)P(X=i)\]
!et
The probabilities $P(Y=b|X=i)$ correspond to a column in the
transition probability matrix. If each of the initial events
$P(X=i)$ are equally probable, $P(X=i)=1/4$, and $P(Y=b)$
is then the sum of the probabilities in the column corresponding to
$b$, divided by 4. We can now compute $P(Y=b)$ for
$b$ as A, C, G, and T:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/mutate.py fromto: def transition_into_bases@# Test large data

The $P(X=b)$ probabilities corresponding to the example run above reads
!bc dat
{'A': 0.26, 'C': 0.25, 'T': 0.30, 'G': 0.19}
!ec
Transition into T ($P(Y=T)$) has greatest probability (0.3) and this is also
confirmed by the greatest frequency (0.41).
